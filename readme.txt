This repository consist of script for plotting Radiation patterns of various type of Uniform and Non-Uniform Linear Antenna Arrays

The different configurations taken into consideration are Uniform Array, Binomial Array, Dolph Chebyshev Array and Edge Array.

The variable parameters are-

1) N - Number of Antennas in Array
2) Î» - Wavelength
3) d - Distance between adjecent antennas
4) R - Major to minor lobe ratio for Dolph Chebyshev antenna
